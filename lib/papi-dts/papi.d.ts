     * default, no urls are available to be iframes. If you want to embed iframes with the `src`
     * attribute in your webview, you must include them in this property.

     * `https://example.com/`

     * [`test`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/RegExp/test)
     * function) to determine whether this iframe will be allowed to load. Specifying urls in this
     * array is essentially a security check to make sure the url you pass is one of the urls you
     * intend it to be. By default, the url you specify in `content` will be accepted (you do not have
     * to specify this unless you want to, but it is recommended in some scenarios).
     *
     * Note: URL WebViews must have `papi-extension:` or `https:` urls. This property does not
     * override that requirement.

     * For example, if you specify `allowFrameSources: ['^papi-extension:',
     * '^https://example\\.com.*']`, only `papi-extension:` and `https://example.com` urls will be
     * accepted.
     *
     * If your WebView url is a `const` string and cannot change for any reason, you do not need to

   *
   * ### Setting
   *
   * The `Setting` data type handles getting and setting project settings. All Project Data Providers
   * must implement these methods `getSetting` and `setSetting` as well as `resetSetting` in order to
   * properly support project settings.
   *
   * Note: the `Setting` data type is not actually part of {@link MandatoryProjectDataTypes} because
   * the methods would not be able to create a generic type extending from `ProjectSettingNames` in
   * order to return the specific setting type being requested. As such, `getSetting`, `setSetting`,
   * and `subscribeSetting` are all specified on {@link IProjectDataProvider} instead. Unfortunately,
   * as a result, using Intellisense with `useProjectData` will not show `Setting` as a data type
   * option, but you can use `useProjectSetting` instead. However, do note that the `Setting` data
   * type is fully functional.
   *
   * The closest possible representation of the `Setting` data type follows:
   *
   * ```typescript
   * Setting: DataProviderDataType<
   *   ProjectSettingNames,
   *   ProjectSettingTypes[ProjectSettingNames],
   *   ProjectSettingTypes[ProjectSettingNames]
   * >;
   * ```
   *
   * WARNING: Each Project Data Provider **must** fulfill the following requirements for its
   * settings-related methods:
   *
   * - `getSetting`: if a project setting value is present for the key requested, return it. Otherwise,
   *   you must call `papi.projectSettings.getDefault` to get the default value or throw if that call
   *   throws. This functionality preserves the intended type of the setting and avoids returning
   *   `undefined` unexpectedly.
   * - `setSetting`: must call `papi.projectSettings.isValid` before setting the value and should return
   *   false if the call returns `false` and throw if the call throws. This functionality preserves
   *   the intended intended type of the setting and avoids allowing the setting to be set to the
   *   wrong type.
   * - `resetSetting`: deletes the value at the key and sends a setting update event. After this,
   *   `getSetting` should again see the setting value is not present, call
   *   `papi.projectSettings.getDefault`, and return the default value.
   * - Note: see {@link WithProjectDataProviderEngineSettingMethods} for method signatures for these
   *   three methods.
   *
   *   .---
   *
   * ### ExtensionData
   *
   * All Project Data Provider data types must have an `ExtensionData` type. We strongly recommend all
   * Project Data Provider data types extend from this type in order to standardize the
   * `ExtensionData` types.
   *
   * Benefits of following this standard:
   *
   * - If an extension uses the `ExtensionData` endpoint for any project, it will likely use this
   *   standardized interface, so using this interface on your Project Data Provider data types
   *   enables your PDP to support generic extension data
   * - In the future, we may enforce that callers to `ExtensionData` endpoints include `extensionName`,
   *   so following this interface ensures your PDP will not break if such a requirement is
   *   implemented.

   * add more Project Data Providers with corresponding `projectInterface`s by adding details to
   * their `.d.ts` file and registering a Project Data Provider factory with the corresponding
   * `projectInterface`.
   *
   * There are two types of Project Data Providers (and Project Data Provider Factories that serve
   * them):
   *
   * 1. Base Project Data Provider - provides project data via some `projectInterface`s for its own
   *    projects with **its own unique project ids**. These PDPs **must support the `platform.base`
   *    `projectInterface` by implementing {@link IBaseProjectDataProvider}**. More information
   *    below.
   * 2. Layering Project Data Provider - layers over other PDPs and provides additional
   *    `projectInterface`s for projects on other PDPs. Likely **does not provide its own unique
   *    project ids** but rather layers over base PDPs' project ids. These PDPs **do not need to
   *    support the `platform.base` `projectInterface` and should instead implement
   *    {@link IProjectDataProvider}**. Instead of providing projects themselves, they likely use the
   *    `ExtensionData` data type exposed via the `platform.base` `projectInterface` on Base PDPs to
   *    provide additional project data on top of Base PDPs.
   *
   * All Base Project Data Provider Interfaces' data types **must** implement
   * {@link IBaseProjectDataProvider} (which extends {@link MandatoryProjectDataTypes}) like in the
   * following example. Please see its documentation for information on how Project Data Providers
   * can implement this interface.
   *
   * Note: The keys of this interface are the `projectInterface`s for the associated Project Data
   * Provider Interfaces. `projectInterface`s represent standardized sets of methods on a PDP.
   *
   * WARNING: Each Base Project Data Provider **must** fulfill certain requirements for its
   * `getSetting`, `setSetting`, `resetSetting`, `getExtensionData`, and `setExtensionData` methods.
   * See {@link IBaseProjectDataProvider} and {@link MandatoryProjectDataTypes} for more information.
   *
   * An extension can extend this interface to add types for the Project Data Provider Interfaces

   * `projectInterface` and a Layering Project Data Provider interface for the
   * `MyExtensionLayeringProjectInterface` `projectInterface`):
